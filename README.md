### â„–1 binary search

<p>
    Binary search is an algorithm; it receives a sorted list as input (this is important!). If the element you are looking for is present in the list, then binary search returns the position in which it was found. Otherwise, the binary search will return null.

### â„–2 Bubble sort 

<p>
    Bubble sort is probably the simplest sort I've come across. It is usually found in books on programming and does not go beyond it. Because it is much slower than other sorting algorithms.
    How the bubble sort algorithm works
    The principle of operation of bubble sort can be described in three points:
    Walking through the entire array;
    Comparison of pairs of adjacent cells;
    If during comparison it turns out that the value of cell i is greater than the value of cell i + 1, then we swap the values â€‹â€‹of these cells;
</p>
